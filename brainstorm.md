## Ideas

[x] Logger. Users can set logger to true, and then Servemon will use Morgan to log sites. Like when a user go to a file it will console.log it

[x] Create a version command that shows the version of the users current servemon version.

[x] Create a function that checks if the current user is using the latest version of the servemon.

JUST AN IDEA OKAY!!!

[] Build command that can bundle the users html, css, javascript files into a build
